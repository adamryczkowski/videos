#!/usr/bin/env bash
# spack-ensure.sh - Ensure Spack is installed and the project environment is ready
# This script is called by the justfile to bootstrap Spack if needed.
#
# ARCHITECTURE NOTE:
# This script contains bash-based version compatibility logic that mirrors the Python
# implementation in the Cookiecutters repository's version-discovery module.
#
# The version selection architecture has two phases:
# 1. TEMPLATE INSTANTIATION TIME: The Python-based spack-version-discovery module
#    (in the Cookiecutters repo) uses sophisticated algorithms to select optimal
#    tool versions based on what's available locally, in buildcaches, and in the
#    Spack repository. This runs when `cookiecutter` generates a new project.
#
# 2. RUNTIME (this script): Generated projects need self-contained bash logic for
#    runtime checks because they don't have access to the version-discovery module.
#    This script handles:
#    - Checking if compatible versions are already installed
#    - Installing missing packages via Spack
#    - Setting up the project environment
#
# The compatibility rules implemented here should match those in:
#   version-discovery/spack_version_discovery/selector.py::_is_version_compatible()
#
# Tool-specific compatibility rules:
#   - gcc/llvm/clang: major version match is enough (e.g., 21.x matches 21)
#   - python: major.minor must match (e.g., 3.12.x matches 3.12)
#   - cmake/ninja: major.minor must match
#   - node/openjdk: major version match is enough
